# Local First

This is text in my README.md file.

Adding some more stuff. But this new stuff, will likely create a merge conflict.

Adding more text for the third time. 

Now making an edit in Rstudio. Keeping this too: Add some new changes on Github to create a push conflict.

# Branch

Making a change in the branch version right now.

# Data
